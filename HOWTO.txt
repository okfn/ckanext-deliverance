What is ckanext.deliverance? 
============================

Deliverance is an HTTP proxy that can be used to request and render web pages from an external 
site (e.g. a CMS like Drupal, Wordpress). Pages will be loaded from the CMS url, re-styled 
according to a XML specification and delivered to the end user. This allows CKAN to provide 
CMS-managed content pages without the need to include CMS functionality.


Setup
-----

1. Install ckanextdeliverance from mercurial using pip -e. 
2. Add the following entries to your CKAN .ini file::

    ckan.plugins = deliverance
    deliverance.base = http://your_cms_url/
    deliverance.rules = %(here)s/deliverance_rules.xml
    
  There are also two optional settings::
  
    # will add trailing slashes to all requests if necessary:
    deliverance.add_slash = true 
    
    # will replace each occurence of ``deliverance.base`` with 
    # CKAN's ``ckan.site_url``:
    deliverance.replace_url = true
    
3. Set up a deliverance rules file. This file specified transformation and replacement rules
   that are needed to copy the CMS page contents into CKANs layout. Two very simple examples
   can be found in the ckanextdeliverance repository, while a documentation of the XML 
   format is at: http://packages.python.org/Deliverance/configuration.html
